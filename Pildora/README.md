This pildora is for talking about the below events in JS:
- mouseenter
- onclick
- input

What I'll explain is how each of the topics work.

Event mouseenter
It fires when a cursor enters the container, let's say I have a form and configured the username of containing the event mouseenter, what would happen is, whenever my pointer enters this container the event will be triggered, only once, then user will have to remove cursor and enter it again so it can be fired again.

Main difference between mouseenter and hover:
mouseenter fires only once, when pointer is over the container, hover it'll keep active for as long as cursor is on.

Event onclick
will trigger as soon as, for example button, is clicked. "When someone click, do some action", this means it can open a new page once clicked, it can show/hide some content, it open an image or animation.

Event input
It react to each data you're typing, let's say you're filling your password with data, each letter, number, character you add, this event will be fired and, if you want it displayed, not the best practice to display a password to others though, you console.log it and you can clearly see all the input.
